 üë®‚Äçüç≥ Meta-Repo Chef. Culinary git helper to work with code buffets.
 
 ## Why
 
 It has features that no other meta-repo manager has:
 
-- Code is 100% reproducible.
-- Full freeze-warmup-freeze coding cycle.
-- Upstream patching supported.
-- Downstream patching supported.
-- Mixed and multi-patching repo supported.
-- Automated updates.
-- Automatic disk space economization with [git-autoshare][].
-- Food! ü•ò

+-   Food! ü•ò
 
 Let's dive in. Imagine you need to create an app that requires many unrelated modules to
 be properly glued together. How would you organize your source code?
 
 There are multiple answers to that question:
 
-- Use separate repos and glue them together through packaging. But what if some code you
-  need isn't properly packaged? What if some dependencies need more than 1 patch to
-  work?
-- Use [a monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo). However, what happens if
-  some parts are open source and you need to upstream or review changes?
-- Use [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). However,
-  that requires that every time you do a `git checkout`... or almost any git command...,
-  you need to use some `--recurse-submodules` flag. Also it gives _a lot_ of headaches
-  when you move files around and perform basically any operation. And what if you need
-  to merge 2 upstream patches?
-- Use [git subtrees](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-subtree). But then, you
-  need even more deep knowledge than with submodules to be able to review or publish
-  patches. And again, how to merge more than one patch?
-- Use [Pijul](https://pijul.org/posts/2022-01-07-monorepos/). But the world isn't ready
-  for it yet. Still we need Git.

 The solution is to [use a meta-repo](https://notes.burke.libbey.me/metarepo/). There are
 many meta-repo managers out there, but none of them has all the features that I already
 told you about Mr. Chef.
 
 ## Glossary
 
 Mr. Chef introduces a new code management concept based on the metaphor of a buffet. Use
 this glossary to understand the rest of the recipe... readme! Sorry...
 
-- _Buffet_ is the main git repository that contains all the instructions to build it.
-- The _config file_ is a file named `mrchef.toml` that stands in the root of your
-  _buffet_ and configures what Mr. Chef should do.
-- The _kitchen_ is the root folder, inside the _buffet_, where you can find the _meals_.
-  It's configured inside the _config file_.
-- A _meal_ is like a git submodule: another git repo inside your _kitchen_.
-- A _spice_ is a patch that is added to a _meal_.
-- The _freezer_ is where we store the gory details needed to make the kitchen 100%
-  reproducible. Mr. Chef saves it in a file called `.mrchef.freezer.toml`.
-- _Warming up_ means getting meals outside of the _freezer_ and putting them in the
-  _kitchen_, ready to cook!
-- _Freezing_ means writing a new _freezer_ that can reproduce what's currently _warmed
-  up_ in the _kitchen_.

OK:\n\n```sh\nmrchef spice-add kitchen/hello https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/pull/2256\nmrchef spice-add kitchen/hello https://github.com/octocat/Hello-World/pull/34\n```\n\nDid `master` get new commits? Or did those PRs get updated? Update everything:\n\n```sh\nmrchef update\n```\n\nCool, huh? üòè Mr. Chef can do more things!

 üë®‚Äçüç≥ Meta-Repo Chef. Culinary git helper to work with code buffets.
 
 ## Why
 
 It has features that no other meta-repo manager has:
 
-- Code is 100% reproducible.
-- Full freeze-warmup-freeze coding cycle.
-- Upstream patching supported.
-- Downstream patching supported.
-- Mixed and multi-patching repo supported.
-- Automated updates.
-- Automatic disk space economization with [git-autoshare][].
-- Food! ü•ò

+-   Food! ü•ò
 
 Let's dive in. Imagine you need to create an app that requires many unrelated modules to
 be properly glued together. How would you organize your source code?
 
 There are multiple answers to that question:
 
-- Use separate repos and glue them together through packaging. But what if some code you
-  need isn't properly packaged? What if some dependencies need more than 1 patch to
-  work?
-- Use [a monorepo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monorepo). However, what happens if
-  some parts are open source and you need to upstream or review changes?
-- Use [git submodules](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules). However,
-  that requires that every time you do a `git checkout`... or almost any git command...,
-  you need to use some `--recurse-submodules` flag. Also it gives _a lot_ of headaches
-  when you move files around and perform basically any operation. And what if you need
-  to merge 2 upstream patches?
-- Use [git subtrees](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-subtree). But then, you
-  need even more deep knowledge than with submodules to be able to review or publish
-  patches. And again, how to merge more than one patch?
-- Use [Pijul](https://pijul.org/posts/2022-01-07-monorepos/). But the world isn't ready
-  for it yet. Still we need Git.

 The solution is to [use a meta-repo](https://notes.burke.libbey.me/metarepo/). There are
 many meta-repo managers out there, but none of them has all the features that I already
 told you about Mr. Chef.
 
 ## Glossary
 
 Mr. Chef introduces a new code management concept based on the metaphor of a buffet. Use
 this glossary to understand the rest of the recipe... readme! Sorry...
 
-- _Buffet_ is the main git repository that contains all the instructions to build it.
-- The _config file_ is a file named `mrchef.toml` that stands in the root of your
-  _buffet_ and configures what Mr. Chef should do.
-- The _kitchen_ is the root folder, inside the _buffet_, where you can find the _meals_.
-  It's configured inside the _config file_.
-- A _meal_ is like a git submodule: another git repo inside your _kitchen_.
-- A _spice_ is a patch that is added to a _meal_.
-- The _freezer_ is where we store the gory details needed to make the kitchen 100%
-  reproducible. Mr. Chef saves it in a file called `.mrchef.freezer.toml`.
-- _Warming up_ means getting meals outside of the _freezer_ and putting them in the
-  _kitchen_, ready to cook!
-- _Freezing_ means writing a new _freezer_ that can reproduce what's currently _warmed
-  up_ in the _kitchen_.
